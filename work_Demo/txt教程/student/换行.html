            评教作为教学质量的检测指标，在教务管理中有着举足轻重的地位。设计一个合理的网上教务评教系统，不仅可以有效的提高评教工作的效率，还可以节约成本，对之后的信息维护也有很大帮助。在对系统进行可行性分析和功能、性能分析后，进行了总体设计和详细设计，并实现了系统的基础功能。通过黑盒测试等方法对系统进行了多方面测试。本次系统划分了三类用户，即学生、教师、管理员。主要采用SSM框架，使用B/S三层架构，能够完成基础的选课和评教功能。另外，本次系统还添加了作业的提交和批改的功能。
            As a test index of teaching quality, evaluation of teaching plays a pivotal role in the management of
            academic
            affairs.
            Designing a reasonable online teaching evaluation system can not only effectively improve the efficiency of
            the
            evaluation work, but also save costs, and also be of great help to the subsequent information maintenance.
            After
            the
            feasibility analysis and functional and performance analysis of the system, the overall design and detailed
            design were
            carried out, and the basic functions of the system were realized. The system was tested in many ways by
            methods
            such as
            black box testing. The system is divided into three categories of users, namely students, teachers, and
            administrators.
            Mainly using the SSM framework, using B/S three-tier architecture, it can complete the basic course
            selection
            and
            evaluation functions. In addition, the system has also added the function of submitting and grading jobs.
